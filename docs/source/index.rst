Welcome to PyMIC's documentation!
===================================

PyMIC is a pytorch-based toolkit for medical image computing with annotation-efficient deep learning.
PyMIC is developed to support learning with imperfect labels, including semi-supervised and weakly supervised learning, and learning with noisy annotations.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

.. note::

   This project is under active development. It will be updated later.
